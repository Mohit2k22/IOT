Arduino Soccer Bot Project

Overview:
The Arduino Soccer Bot is a robotics project that combines mechanical design, electronics, and programming to create a robot capable of playing soccer autonomously or via remote control. It's an excellent project for learning about Arduino microcontrollers, motor control, sensors, and wireless communication.

Objective:
The goal of the project is to build a small robot that can move around a field,
and attempt to push it toward a goal. It can be used in one-on-one matches or team-based robot soccer games. 

Working Principle:
• Based on input, the Arduino processes and decides movement direction.
• Motors drive the robot toward the ball.
• A bot mechanism can strike the ball toward the goal.
• If remote-controlled, the user directs the bot via a Bluetooth-connected controller or phone.

Applications:
• Educational tool for robotics and STEM learning.
• Prototype for autonomous sports robots.
• Great for competitions like RoboSoccer or DIY robotics challenges.
